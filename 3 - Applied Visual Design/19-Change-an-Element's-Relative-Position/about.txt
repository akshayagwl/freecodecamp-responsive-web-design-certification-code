Applied Visual Design: Adjust the Hover State of an Anchor Tag
This challenge will touch on the usage of pseudo-classes. A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be
added to selectors, in order to select a specific state of the element.

For example, the styling of an anchor tag can be changed for its hover state using the :hover pseudo-class
 selector. Here's the CSS to change the color of the anchor tag to red during its hover state:

a:hover {
  color: red;
}

The code editor has a CSS rule to style all a tags black. Add a rule so that when the user hovers over the
 a tag, the color is blue.

The anchor tag color should remain black, only add CSS rules for the :hover state.
The anchor tag should have a color of blue on hover.
