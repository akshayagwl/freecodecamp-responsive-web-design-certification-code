<!-- Change the position of the h2 to relative, and use a CSS offset to move it 15 pixels away
from the top of where it sits in the normal flow. Notice there is no impact on the positions of the
 surrounding h1 and p elements. -->

<style>
  h2 {

      position: relative;
      /* the following moves it to the right 100px and to the bottom 35px; */
      /* left: 100px;
      top: 35px; */
      top: 15px;

  }
</style>
<body>
  <h1>On Being Well-Positioned</h1>
  <h2>Move me!</h2>
  <p>I still think the h2 is where it normally sits.</p>
